// 1. Console log a line of text eg. "this is an exercise in console logging". (do not forget quotation marks). 
console.log("this is an exercise in console logging");
// 2. Declare a variable and give your variable the following value: "This is the value.". Console log your **variable**. 
let string = "This is the value.";
console.log(string);
// 3. Declare a variable called firstName and assign your first name to that variable. Do they same with your last name. Console log both variables. NOTE: When console logging two variables, separate the variables with a comma (,) in the console log e.g. console.log(variable1, variable2);
let firstName = "Henk";
let lastName = "Johnsson";
console.log(firstName, lastName);
// 4. Make a profile of someone's information. Store all the information in variables eg. name, city, job etc. (five variables total) Console log the variables. 
let name = "John Smith";
let job = "Teacher";
let city = "Berlin";
let hobby = "Javascript";
let age = 30;
console.log(name, job, city, hobby, age);

// 5. Print the sentence "John Smith is a 43 year old teacher who lives in Berlin" using variables (where possible) and text. **you can combine variables with text in the console by using the plus symbol (+) e.g. console.log("this is a " + variable);**
console.log(name + " is a " + age + " year old " + job + " who lives in " + city);
